UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB18 and RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB18 and RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 464 of such cell types but only 280 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 232 of such cell types but only 140 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#3 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
RAMB36E1 over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more RAMB36E1 cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 232 of such cell types but only 140 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
168 out of 168 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: addra[17:0], addrb[17:0], clka, clkb, dina[31:0], dinb[31:0], douta[31:0],
doutb[31:0], wea[0], web[0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
168 out of 168 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: addra[17:0], addrb[17:0], clka, clkb, dina[31:0], dinb[31:0], douta[31:0],
doutb[31:0], wea[0], web[0].
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
